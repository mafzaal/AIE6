"Hey, can u tell me what’s the deal with John Wick movie, like what’s the story about and why it’s so cool, ya know?","["": 0\nReview: The best way I can describe John Wick is to picture Taken but instead of Liam Neeson it's Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it's his dog. That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.""]","John Wick is basically like Taken, but with Keanu Reeves instead of Liam Neeson, and it’s about his dog instead of a daughter.

Excellent acting performance by Keanu Reeves a.k.a John Wick. The guns shooting scenes were entirely cool. I would recommend this movie to any fans of action movie.

Failing that, the gory mayhem had better be something special - something that breaks new ground in terms of action cinema. John Wick Chapter 2 is relentlessly violent, Keanu Reeves' eponymous hitman laying waste to almost everyone he crosses paths with, once again finishing most victims with a shot to the head, but the action is simply more of the same, director Chad Stahelski bringing nothing new to the table."", '<3-hop>\n\n: 17\nReview: There are actually quite a handful reasons why ""John Wick"" could have become a failure. The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad\'s script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.']","The movie reviews for 'John Wick' and 'John Wick Chapter 2' present contrasting opinions on the action scenes and overall cinematic experience. For 'John Wick,' the review highlights it as a surprising success despite initial low expectations due to the inexperience of the directors, writer, and Keanu Reeves' typical roles. It praises the film as a very good, gutsy revenge thriller that doesn't aim for great cinematic value or groundbreaking stories but delivers effectively within its genre. On the other hand, the review for 'John Wick Chapter 2' is more critical, noting that while it is relentlessly violent with Keanu Reeves' character taking down almost everyone, the action lacks innovation, with director Chad Stahelski bringing nothing new to the table. However, another review for an unspecified 'John Wick' movie, likely the first or a general sentiment, rates it a perfect 10/10, calling it amazing and one of the best action movies, with wonderfully choreographed fighting scenes and excellent acting by Keanu Reeves, recommending it highly to action movie fans. Thus, while the original 'John Wick' is celebrated for exceeding expectations and delivering memorable action, 'John Wick Chapter 2' is critiqued for not pushing boundaries in action cinema despite its intensity.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

If you have seen John Wick the original (which I hope you have seen it before you see this one), then you will be amazed with this sequel. It was bloodier, more fighting, more assassins trying to kill John and longer running time. What I can say is this is an even better version than the original movie.

"Considering the evolution of the John Wick franchise, how has the portrayal of John as a character changed from 'John Wick: Chapter 2' to the fourth chapter in terms of his resilience and believability, and what impact has this had on the overall identity of the series according to the reviews?","['<1-hop>\n\n: 4\nReview: I went to the cinema with great expectations. I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. ""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.', '<2-hop>\n\n: 0\nReview: No doubt about it, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a slick action thriller, but man, oh man, how can any one person absorb that kind of punishment?
