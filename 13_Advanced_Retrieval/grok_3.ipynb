      "Yes, people generally liked *John Wick*. The 2014 action film, starring Keanu Reeves, received widespread praise from both audiences and critics. It holds an 86% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on critic reviews and an 85% audience score, indicating strong positive reception. Fans often highlight the movie's stylish action choreography, Reeves' intense performance, and the unique world-building around the assassin underworld. On platforms like IMDb, it has a rating of 7.4/10 based on over 700,000 user votes, further showing its popularity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film also gained a cult following, spawning three sequels (with a fourth released in 2023) and a prequel series, *The Continental*. Social media and online discussions often reflect enthusiasm for the character and the franchise, with many appreciating its emotional depth (centered on Wick's grief) alongside the high-octane action. However, some viewers criticize the plot for being thin or overly simplistic, focusing more on revenge than complex storytelling. Despite this, the general consensus leans heavily positive, especially for action movie fans."

That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.\")"

The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad\\'s script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.']",
         "The movie reviews for 'John Wick' and 'John Wick Chapter 2' present contrasting opinions on the action scenes and overall cinematic experience. For 'John Wick,' the review highlights it as a surprising success despite initial low expectations due to the inexperience of the directors, writer, and Keanu Reeves' typical roles. It praises the film as a very good, gutsy revenge thriller that doesn't aim for great cinematic value or groundbreaking stories but delivers effectively within its genre. On the other hand, the review for 'John Wick Chapter 2' is more critical, noting that while it is relentlessly violent with Keanu Reeves' character taking down almost everyone, the action lacks innovation, with director Chad Stahelski bringing nothing new to the table. However, another review for an unspecified 'John Wick' movie, likely the first or a general sentiment, rates it a perfect 10/10, calling it amazing and one of the best action movies, with wonderfully choreographed fighting scenes and excellent acting by Keanu Reeves, recommending it highly to action movie fans. Thus, while the original 'John Wick' is celebrated for exceeding expectations and delivering memorable action, 'John Wick Chapter 2' is critiqued for not pushing boundaries in action cinema despite its intensity.",

I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated.

Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore.
