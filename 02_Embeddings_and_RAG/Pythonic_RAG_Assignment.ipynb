This can happen when a CEO, who has expertise in a specific area like product management, sales, or marketing, selects someone less competent for that role to ensure they can remain prominent and influential (“the man”) in that specific function. This problem highlights the risk of allowing personal biases and insecurities to influence hiring decisions, which can lead to poor organizational performance. The term is based on the example of Michael Eisner, who struggled to turn around ABC after acquiring it, despite his previous success as a TV network executive.',\n",
